## About the project
A proof of concept demo of how to write microservices in various technologies and how to bind them together to make one seemless application.

### Motivation
If you have not been living under the rock for a while, microservice is the defacto architecure to make large scale applications these days. Lot of companies have moved to monolithic architecure to microservice based architecture.

I have been writing microservices for a while. But I remember having little to no resource on the web for how to stick all the different parts together. I had to struggle a lot and find solutions with trial and error. That's why I started writing this repo to demonstrate programmers how they can get started with microservices.
